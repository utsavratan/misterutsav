Hi I am Utsav Ratan
I am a CSE Student at KR Mangalam UniversityI am passionate about technology and its impact on our daily lives. My interests lie in software development and artificial intelligence, and I often spend my free time working on personal projects to enhance my skills. At KR Mangalam University, I have had the opportunity to learn from experienced professors and collaborate with fellow students who share my enthusiasm for computer science. 

I believe that practical experience is just as important as theoretical knowledge, so I actively participate in hackathons and coding competitions to challenge myself and apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios. With every project, whether itâ€™s designing a simple app or delving into complex algorithms, I feel more motivated to push the boundaries of what I can create. 

I am looking forward to the future and am excited about the endless possibilities within the tech industry. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that can make a difference in society and inspire others to pursue their passions in technology.
